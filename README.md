# Antibiotic treatment increases bacterial community diversity in the sea anemone, _Exaiptasia diaphana_

This repo contains the QIIME2 and R code used to analyse data from a study described by the following abstract:

*Coral reefs are declining due to anthropogenic disturbances, including climate change. Therefore, improving our understanding of coral ecosystems is vital, and the influence of bacteria on coral health has attracted particular interest. However, a gnotobiotic coral model that could enhance studies of coral-bacteria interactions is absent. To address this gap, we tested the ability of treatment with seven antibiotics for three weeks to deplete bacteria in Exaiptasia diaphana, a sea anemone widely used as a coral model. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) targeting the anemone Ef1-α and bacterial 16S rRNA genes was used to quantify bacterial load, which was found to decrease 6-fold. However, metabarcoding of bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed that alpha and beta diversity of the anemone-associated bacterial communities increased significantly. Therefore, gnotobiotic E. diaphana with simplified, uniform bacterial communities were not generated. Despite this outcome, our work will inform future efforts to create a much needed gnotobiotic coral model.*
